# Remote MCP Server on Cloudflare

Let's get a remote MCP server up-and-running on Cloudflare Workers complete with OAuth login!

## Develop locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should be able to open [`http://localhost:8787/`](http://localhost:8787/) in your browser

## Connect the MCP inspector to your server

To explore your new MCP api, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

- Start it with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
- [Within the inspector](http://localhost:5173), switch the Transport Type to `SSE` and enter `http://localhost:8787/sse` as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect"
- You will navigate to a (mock) user/password login screen. Input any email and pass to login.
- You should be redirected back to the MCP Inspector and you can now list and call any defined tools!

## Deploy to Cloudflare

1. `npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV`
2. Follow the guidance to add the kv namespace ID to `wrangler.jsonc`
3. `npm run deploy`
